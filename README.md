# Comparing-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
A comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms

3 regression algorithms, Linear Regression, Decision tree and Bagged Random Forest were employed and compared for Vacation home rental prices prediction

2 classification algorithms, Support vector machine (SVM) with different kernels and logistic regression were compared for online shoppers intention classification problem.

2 classification algorithms k nearest neighbours (KNN) and decision trees were used and compared for credit card default evaluation.
